n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
 -> n = variable -> to store a entered number
result = 0 
 -> result = 0 -> Initially the sum result is '0'
while(n > 0): 
 -> while loop -> to iterate the block of statement
m = n % 10 
 -> to get the unit digit
result = result + m 
 -> result gets sum up with the previous result
n = n // 10 
 -> floor division (//) -> returns only the integer value -> to eliminate the unit digit
print("Sum of digits: ",result) 
 -> display the sum result
