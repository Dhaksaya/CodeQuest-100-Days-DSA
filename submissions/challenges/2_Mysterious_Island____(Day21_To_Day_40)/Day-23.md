## **Day 23: The Word Collector – Shabd Ka Sangrah!** 📚✨

### **📜 Story / Kahani**  
In the heart of Mysterious Island, tumhe ek ancient manuscript mila hai jisme purani kahaniyaan likhi hain. But the manuscript is jumbled – words scattered everywhere!  
Echo says,  
*"Yaar, yeh manuscript sirf un logon ke liye hai jo shabdon ka sahi sangrah kar sakte hain. Collect the words and count their magic!"*  

Your task is to **count the frequency of each word** in the given text and display the results. This will reveal hidden clues to the next location.

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Text Manipulation:**  
  - Consider converting the text to lower case to make counting consistent.  
  - Remove punctuation if necessary.  
- **Data Structures:**  
  - Use a dictionary (or hashmap) to store word frequencies.  
- **Language Flexibility:**  
  - Use built-in methods in Python like `split()` and loops, or equivalent in C++, Java, etc.

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day23_word_collector.[ext]` (for example, `day23_word_collector.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote / Uplifting Message**

### **😂 Echo’s Dad Joke of the Day**
