## **Day 22: The Binary Bridge – Crossing the Data River** 🚀

### **📜 Story**  
In the heart of Mysterious Island, you stumble upon a rickety bridge constructed entirely of binary digits. To cross safely, you must decipher its secret code by converting binary to decimal.  
Echo advises,  
*"Convert the code, and the bridge will reveal its safe path. Agar tum stuck ho, thoda relax karke phir try karo!"*

### **🎯 Challenge: Binary to Decimal Converter**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes a binary string as input.**  
2. **Converts it into its decimal equivalent.**  
3. **Prints the decimal number.**

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter binary number: 1010
```  
**Output:**  
```
Decimal: 10
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter binary number: 1101
```  
**Output:**  
```
Decimal: 13
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter binary number: 1001
```  
**Output:**  
```
Decimal: 9
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- You can use built-in functions like `int(binary_string, 2)` in Python.  
- Alternatively, iterate over the string from right to left, multiplying each digit by 2 raised to the appropriate power, then sum the results.

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day22_binary_bridge.[ext]` (e.g., `day22_binary_bridge.py`).
