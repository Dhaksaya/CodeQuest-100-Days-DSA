## **Day 29: The Overlapping Scroll – Common Elements Revealed!** 📜🔍

### **📜 Story / Kahani**  
Ab tum ancient scrolls ke ek purane library mein pahunche ho, jahan do alag scrolls milte hain.  
Echo bolta hai,  
*"Yaar, in dono scrolls mein kuch common baatein likhi hain – wahi tumhe agla raasta dikhayengi! Find the overlapping elements, and the secret path will be revealed."*  

Nariyal Bhai thoda muskurata hai:  
*"College assignments mein hum aksar group work karte hain – ab socho, jab do lists milti hain, to common cheezein hi sabse important hoti hain!"*  

Mayur adds dramatically,  
*"Bas, common elements nikal lo, aur dekhna kaise yeh tumhe next clue ki taraf le jaata hai!"*

### **🎯 Challenge: Find Common Elements / Common Intersection**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes two lists of integers as input.**  
2. **Finds and prints the common elements** (intersection) between these two lists.  
3. **If there are no common elements, print an appropriate message.**

*Note:*  
- The elements in each list can be space-separated.  
- The order of elements in the output doesn’t matter, but each common element should be printed only once.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter first list: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter second list: 4 5 6 7 8
```  
**Output:**  
```
Common elements: 4 5
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter first list: 10 20 30 40
Enter second list: 5 15 25 35
```  
**Output:**  
```
No common elements found!
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter first list: 3 3 6 9
Enter second list: 3 9 12 15
```  
**Output:**  
```
Common elements: 3 9
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Python:** Use `set()` operations to quickly find intersections.  
- **C++/Java:** Consider sorting the arrays or using hash-based data structures (like `unordered_set` or `HashSet`) to store elements and find common values.  
- Iterate through one list and check for membership in the other list.

---

### **📝 Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day29_overlapping_scroll.[ext]` (e.g., `day29_overlapping_scroll.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote / Uplifting Message**  
*"Jab alag alag raaste milte hain, tab unmein common cheezein hi tumhe sahi manzil tak le jaati hain. Keep finding the intersections in life and code!"* 🚀

### **😂 Echo’s Dad Joke of the Day**  
*"Why did the array go to therapy?"*  
Because it couldn't deal with its **"issues of separation"** until it found common ground! 😆

The overlapping scrolls have revealed their secret – common elements ka raaz tumhari agla mission khol dega. Ab taiyaar ho jao for **Day 30** as the adventure continues!
