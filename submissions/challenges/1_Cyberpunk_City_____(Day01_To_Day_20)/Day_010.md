## **Day 10: The Lock 🔐**  

### **📜 Story**  
You’ve decrypted the message, but there’s a **new problem**. It’s just a **random set of numbers!** 🤯  

*"It looks like a **password-protected vault**,"* Echo says. *"We need to check if the password is **strong enough** before we use it!"*  

To move forward, you must **write a program to check if a given password is strong.**  

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Password Strength Checker**  
A password is considered **strong** if:  
✅ It has at least **8 characters**  
✅ It contains at least **one uppercase letter (A-Z)**  
✅ It contains at least **one lowercase letter (a-z)**  
✅ It contains at least **one digit (0-9)**  
✅ It contains at least **one special character** (like `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)  

**Write a program that:**  
1. **Takes a password as input**  
2. **Checks if it meets all the strength requirements**  
3. **Prints “Strong Password” or “Weak Password”**

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**  

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter your password: Code@123
```  
**Output:**  
```
Strong Password
```  

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter your password: hello123
```  
**Output:**  
```
Weak Password (Missing uppercase letter and special character)
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- You can **loop through the string** and check each condition.  
- In Python, use **`isupper()`**, **`islower()`**, and **`isdigit()`** to check characters.  
- In Java, use **`Character.isUpperCase()`**, **`Character.isDigit()`**, etc.  

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Solve this challenge in **any programming language** of your choice.  
- Save your file as `day10_password.[ext]` (e.g., `day10_password.py`).
