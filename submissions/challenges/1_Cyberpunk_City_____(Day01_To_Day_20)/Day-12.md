## **Day 12: The First Key 🔑**  

### **📜 Story**  
The **instructions** you sorted yesterday **decode** into something shocking...  

*"Go to the Dark Terminal, input the sequence, and retrieve the first key,"* Echo reads aloud.  

The Debuggers’ old hideout has **a hidden terminal**, only accessible through a **looped passcode**. The Glitch has corrupted the input system, and you must **use loops** to restore it!  

---

### **🎯 Challenge: The Passcode Loops 🔁**  
You need to create a program that:  
1. **Takes a number (N) as input** (this is the number of times the passcode should be repeated).  
2. **Prints "ACCESS GRANTED" exactly N times**.  

---

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**  

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter N: 3
```  
**Output:**  
```
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
```  

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter N: 5
```  
**Output:**  
```
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
ACCESS GRANTED
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- Use a **for loop** (e.g., `for i in range(N)`) in Python.  
- In C++, a **`for` or `while` loop** will do the trick.  
- In JavaScript, try a **`for (let i = 0; i < N; i++)`** loop.  

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Write your solution in any programming language.  
- Save it as `day12_passcode.[ext]` (e.g., `day12_passcode.py`).

### **🔥 Motivational Quote**  
*"Coding is like magic – when you know the loops, you control the flow!"* 🧙✨

The **Dark Terminal blinks**, confirming the passcode worked. A drawer **opens** revealing the **First Key**! But what **is it for?** Find out in **Day 13!** 🔥
