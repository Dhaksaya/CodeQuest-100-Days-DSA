## **Day 19: The Data Stream – Sorting the Chaos** ⚡🔍

### **📜 Story**  
After unraveling the maze, you reach a room where data flows chaotically—numbers, letters, and symbols all swirling in a vortex!  
Echo shouts,  
*"The data stream is out of order, and chaos reigns here! To restore order, you must sort these numbers and bring clarity to the chaos."*  

The Debuggers believe that sorting this data will reveal a hidden message critical to defeating The Glitch.

### **🎯 Challenge: Sort the Data Stream**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes a list of integers as input** (representing the chaotic data).  
2. **Sorts the list in ascending order.**  
3. **Prints the sorted list** as the key to unlock the hidden message.

### **💡 Hints**  
- Use built-in sorting functions if available (e.g., Python's `sorted()` or the `.sort()` method).  
- If not, implement a simple sorting algorithm like **bubble sort** or **insertion sort**.  
- In languages like C++ or Java, explore standard library functions such as `sort()` in `<algorithm>` or `Arrays.sort()`.

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Solve this challenge using **any programming language** of your choice.  
- Save your file as `day19_sort_stream.[ext]` (e.g., `day19_sort_stream.py`).
