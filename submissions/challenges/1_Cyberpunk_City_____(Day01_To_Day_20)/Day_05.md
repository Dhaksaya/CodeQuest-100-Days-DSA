## **Day 5: Escape the Infinite Loop! 🔄**  

### **📜 Story**  
You're inside the hacker’s hideout, but **The Glitch** has set a trap—an **infinite loop**! 😱 The only way to escape is to **understand how loops work** and use them wisely.  

Echo warns you:  
*"If you’re stuck in an infinite loop, you might never escape! But don’t worry, I believe in you!"*  

Your task: **Write a program to print numbers from 1 to N, but make sure it doesn't run forever!**

### **💡 Hints**  
- **For Loops:** If you know the number of iterations, use a **for loop**.  
- **While Loops:** If you're checking a condition, use a **while loop** (but don’t forget to update the condition!).

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Solve this challenge using **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day5_loops.[ext]` (e.g., `day5_loops.py`).
