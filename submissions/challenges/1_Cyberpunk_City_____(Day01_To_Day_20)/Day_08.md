### **📜 Story**  
You finally escape the locked gate, but Echo warns you:  

*"The Glitch has planted a **self-destruct bomb** in the Cyberpunk City! You need to trigger a countdown from 10 to 1 to defuse it. If you mess up, BOOM!"* 💥  

Your task: **Write a program that prints a countdown from 10 to 1, and then prints "Boom! Just kidding, you saved the city!"**

### **🎯 Challenge: Defuse the Bomb**  
1. **Print numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.**  
2. **After the countdown, print:** `"Boom! Just kidding, you saved the city!"`  
3. **Use a loop** to accomplish this.
