## *Day 4: The Glitch’s Firewall Challenge!* 🔥💻  

### *📜 Story*  
You've made it to the underground hideout, but The Glitch isn't done with you yet! 🚨 A *firewall* is blocking your path, and you need to crack the *security key* to enter.  

Echo scans the firewall and says:  
"The key is always a number, but it follows a pattern. Can you find it?"  

Your task: *Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number!*

### *🎯 Challenge: Sum of Digits*  
1. *Take a number as input* from the user.  
2. *Calculate the sum of its digits.*  
3. *Print the result.*

### *🔍 Example Outputs*  

#### Example 1  

Enter a number: 123
