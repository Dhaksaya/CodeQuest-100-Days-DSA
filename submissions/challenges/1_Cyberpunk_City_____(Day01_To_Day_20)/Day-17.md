## **Day 17: The Fibonacci Path – Unraveling the Sequence of Life** 🔢

### **📜 Story**  
After conquering the temple, you find yourself at a serene garden where the ancient code of nature is inscribed in stone.  
Echo explains,  
*"Behold the Fibonacci sequence—a pattern that appears in flowers, seashells, and even in the way life unfolds. To continue your quest, calculate this mystical sequence!"*  

The Debuggers believe that mastering this sequence will unlock the secrets of nature and guide you safely through the labyrinth ahead.

### **🎯 Challenge: Generate the Fibonacci Sequence**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes an integer \( N \) as input**—the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.  
2. **Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to \( N \) terms.**  

*Recall:*  
- The Fibonacci sequence starts with **0** and **1**.  
- Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter the number of terms: 5
```  
**Output:**  
```
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter the number of terms: 8
```  
**Output:**  
```
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter the number of terms: 1
```  
**Output:**  
```
Fibonacci sequence: 0
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Iterative Approach:**  
  - Initialize two variables for the first two numbers (0 and 1).  
  - Use a loop to calculate the next term by summing the previous two.  
- **Recursive Approach:**  
  - Define a recursive function with base cases for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).  
  - **Note:** A recursive approach can be less efficient for large \( N \), so iteration is preferred.  

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** of your choice (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day17_fibonacci.[ext]` (for example, `day17_fibonacci.py`).

### **😂 Echo’s Dad Joke of the Day**  
*"Why did the Fibonacci number break up with the series?"*  
Because it couldn’t find a common difference! 😆
