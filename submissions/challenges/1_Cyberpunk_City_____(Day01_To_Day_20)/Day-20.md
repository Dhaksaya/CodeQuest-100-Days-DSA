## **Day 20: The Prime Guardian – Prove Your Purity!** 🔥🔢

### **📜 Story**  
At the edge of Cyberpunk City, before you can move on to the next realm, you face the **Prime Guardian**—a digital sentinel who only grants passage to those whose code is **prime**.  
Echo warns,  
*"Only those who can determine if a number is prime may pass. The Guardian demands purity—numbers with no divisors other than 1 and themselves!"*  

Your task: **Write a program that checks if a given number is prime.**

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Prime Number Checker**  
Your program should:  
1. **Take a positive integer as input.**  
2. **Determine if the number is prime.**  
3. **Print "Prime" if it is, or "Not Prime" otherwise.**

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter a number: 7
```  
**Output:**

### **💡 Hints**  
- A **prime number** is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.  
- Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number for an efficient solution.  
- Use a **loop** to test for divisibility and an **if-else** statement to print the result.

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day20_prime_guardian.[ext]` (e.g., `day20_prime_guardian.py`).

### **😂 Echo’s Dad Joke of the Day**
