## **Day 7: The Loop of Destiny 🔄**  

### **📜 Story**  
As you continue your escape, you find a **mysterious locked gate**. Echo scans it and says:  

*"This gate only opens if you repeat a secret word **exactly 5 times**! Time to use loops!"*  

Your task: **Write a program that asks the user for a word and prints it 5 times.**  

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Unlock the Gate**  
1. **Ask the user to enter a word.**  
2. **Print the word 5 times, each on a new line.**  
3. **Use a loop** to accomplish this task.

### **🔍 Example Output**  

#### Example 1  
```
Enter the secret word: CodeQuest  
CodeQuest  
CodeQuest  
CodeQuest  
CodeQuest  
CodeQuest  
```

#### Example 2  
```
Enter the secret word: GlitchBuster  
GlitchBuster

### **💡 Hints**  
- Use a **for loop** or **while loop** to repeat the word.  
- Make sure your loop runs exactly **5 times**.  
- Try experimenting: Can you print the words **on the same line** separated by spaces?
