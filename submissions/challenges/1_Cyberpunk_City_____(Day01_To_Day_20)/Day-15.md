## **Day 15: The Cryptic Maze 🔍**

### **📜 Story**  
After restoring the code on the island, you discover that the next clue is hidden inside a **cryptic maze**.  
Echo explains, *"The maze’s walls are lined with numbers, and only by solving the puzzle can you reveal the secret passage. Let's crack this together!"*  

### **🎯 Challenge: Maze Sum Puzzle**  
Your task is to write a program that:  
1. **Takes a list of integers as input** (representing the maze wall numbers).  
2. **Calculates the sum of these numbers.**  
3. **Prints the total sum,** which represents the secret code to unlock the passage.
